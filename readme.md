### **Task 1.3**: Test the login functionality with invalid credentials (_incorrect username_).
- **Instructions**: Attempt to log in with an _**incorrect username**_ but a valid password. Verify that the login fails and an appropriate error message is displayed.

### **Task 1.4**: Test the login functionality with invalid credentials (_incorrect password_).
- **Instructions**: Attempt to log in with a valid username but an _**incorrect password**_. Verify that the login fails and an appropriate error message is displayed.

### **Task 1.5**: Test the search functionality.
- **Instructions**: Perform searches using different keywords and verify that relevant products are displayed in the search results. Test both exact matches and partial matches.

### **Task 1.6**: Test the sorting functionality on product listings.
- **Instructions**: Sort product listings by different criteria such as price, name, and popularity. Verify that the sorting order is correct and consistent.

### **Task 1.7**: Test the filtering functionality on product listings.
- **Instructions**: Apply various filters (e.g., by category, price range) to product listings. Verify that the filtered results match the selected criteria and that the filter options work as expected.

### **Task 1.8**: Test the checkout process.
- **Instructions**: Add items to the cart, proceed to checkout, and complete the purchase process. Verify that all steps in the checkout flow (e.g., entering shipping address, payment information) work smoothly.

### **Task 1.9**: Test the account creation process.
- **Instructions**: Attempt to create a new user account with valid information. Verify that the account is successfully created and that the user can log in with the newly registered credentials.
